# Maze Challenge

A simple server that controls a player on a maze.

## Setup
Clone into gopath. Then do

`go build main.go`

## Running

./main

## APIs

Create a user with name "xxxxx". Users once created are never deleted!
```
POST to `/create/` with
{
"user":"xxxxx"
}

Response
{
"Error":<string>,
"Message":<string>,
"X":<int>
"Y":<int>
"BaddieX":<int>
"BaddieY":<int>
}

X,Y are the players current position
BaddieX, BaddieY are the destination position
```

Move a user on the board with
```
POST to `/move/` with
{
"user":"xxxxx"
"move":"dir"
}

dir is one of UP | DOWN | RIGHT | LEFT

Response
{
"Error":<string>,
"Message":<string>,
"X":<int>
"Y":<int>
"BaddieX":<int>
"BaddieY":<int>
}

X,Y are the players position after the move
BaddieX, BaddieY are the destination position
```

## Notes
1. If you hit a wall you will just remain where you are no. No special response is given.
1. The only way to know if you have succeeded is if (BaddieX == X && BaddieY == Y). The Server will print the message "xxxx has won".
